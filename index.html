					<h3>Camp</h3>
					<p>
    My summer was spent in the mountains of Switzerland. It is a beautiful country filled with amazing wine, cheese, and nasty, inhospitable people. My time
    was spent at an international childrens' camp nestled in a small town just outside of Neuchatel. It was one of the most emotionally trying experiences I've
    had. Unlike my earlier European travels, it was not characterized by near death experiences or spontaneous adventures. At times it felt as though the camp
    had been specifically designed to test ones emotionally stability and perseverance.
</p>
<p>
    I came here by choice, but after my bank account information was stolen and the account shut down my presence here was all but mandated by the conditions I
    found myself in. Possibly the only people more unhappy with their predicament were two Czech-Romani cousins, Michal and Natalie.
</p>
<p>
    On the way to camp via the Zurich airport, Michal, having eaten an exorbitant amount of chocolate, vomited on the floor of the train car. I removed my
    shirt and mopped it up while comforting the child. I didn't know it at the time, but it would be the beginning of a valuable relationship.
</p>
<p>
    At camp Michal and Natalie found themselves excluded from the camper group. This was in part due to self-isolation and shyness, but largely I believe it to
    be the consequence of language barriers and ethnic discrimination. The lone Czech counselor voiced his disdain of “gypsies” on many occasions.They couldn't
    have been farther away from home.
</p>
<p>
    Being a Kentucky boy, I related. Maybe this is what drew us together. I think I needed them as much as they needed me, maybe more so. They gave me a
    purpose in this shit hole of sleep depredation, condescension, and disrespect. They were facing a far greater injustice than myself and it compelled me to
    act outside of my selfish concerns.
</p>
<p>
    Natalie, was in my family. We spent much of the camp day together and as the camp dragged on I became more and more emotionally invested in her. From the
    beginning I felt an obligation to the both of them and it only grew as the camp went on. I was playing the role of a parent, a guardian, a counselor, and a
    friend. The emotions were unclear and paralleled that of those I feel for my younger half-siblings, but I was overwhelmed by feelings of paternalism.
</p>
<p>
    Today, I feel a love for them, especially Natalie, like I've never felt. Recently, this was expressed in a staff conference while we were conducting camper
    evaluations. Other counselors, especially ones of economic means, were hasty to critique Natalie's behavior as being withdrawn and lethargic. While I do
    not outright disagree, the comments fed my paternalistic feelings and made me feel quite protective. It angered me. It was my “child” whom they were
    speaking about, and in a light that was less than positive.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of each camper evaluation there is a final question. Do we want to give this camper a recommendation to the Ecole (a highly competitive,
    prestigious, and international boarding school). With Natalie the question was not even posed. It was not addressed. It was as if everyone agreed that
    discussion on the subject was unwarranted. I knew that if I brought the question to the table, it would be laughed at, at best.
</p>
<p>
    I approached one of the camp directors during a rare moment of down time and began to discuss the possibility of Natalie attending the Ecole. To my
    amazement, he came to agree with me and now Natalie will be receiving a recommendation. It's a recommendation that carries great weight. If the Ecole has
    the financial resources to cover the annual $50,000 tuition for her (they might), and her family agrees, it's a real possibility that she'll attend.
</p>
<p>
    Theoretically, the planning and decision making at this camp is consensus-based. However, in practice, the decisions are made by the directors and by
    counselors who are given special preference. Normally, I would feel some guilt in subverting the democratic process of a small, well-intended community,
    but in this case, the community is not democratic in the least.
</p>
<p>
    If I've gotten anything out of this summer, if I had any purpose here, surely it was this.
</p>
<p>
    In community organizing and activism it's quite difficult to see if one is making any impact. I'm not going to change the world by working as an advocate
    for one little girl, but the experience reminded me why I chose to go down this road.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes my empathy is lost in the chaos, excitement, and monotony of working for social change. Natalie gave found it, wrapped it in newspaper, smiles,
    and vomit, and gave it back to me.
</p>
<p>
    As of now Natalie can't read this as it is in English. But should she come across it one day, which seems quite unlikely... no... wait.
</p>
<p>
    Natalie, if you see this. <em>Děkuji.</em>

					<h3>Dover</h3>
					<p>London left me mostly unimpressed. I got on a train to Dover and found myself at ease looking out on the green belt. It was quite a change of pace relative to London. People aren't very friendly in the big cities. I suppose I had a preconceived notion of London that didn't really fit the actual experience. Though, I wasn't surprised by the environment... it was just like any big city in the states, but everyone spoke with a British accent. So, the train ride was a nice reprieve.</p>
					<p>When I got off the train I was met by a wave of contentment. Staring right at me, across from the station was a bar with a small hotel above it. The architecture is what you would expect to see in an English storybook for children. This was much better. Off in the distance, atop a small mountain, sat an enormous castle. I started towards it.</p>
					<p>On my ascent I met a couple of locals. They sported long hair, tattered clothing, and a beer and a spliff between them. Like most folks I met in Dover, they seemed dumbfounded as to why an American carrying a sizable rucksack would be wondering around the streets. Since the completion of the tunnel to Calais, France, the local economy had gone to shit. This was followed by a spike in black market activity. Anyway, these guys seemed to think there was plenty of good spots to camp out beside the castle. I took their advice, their hospitality, and proceeded up the hill.</p>
					<p>By the time I reached the top night had fallen and the castle walls were lit up with flood lights. It was quite beautiful, but also rather inconvenient. I planned to get as close to it as possible or better yet, inside. The first obstacle was a short wrought iron fence that I hopped with ease. Knowing that the castle exploration would be physically strenuous, I left my pack behind, concealing it in the brush and covering it with fallen branches. The thought of sneaking around and potentially into a castle was nerve-racking.</p>
					<p>Past the fence was a steep incline, all but vertical. I managed up it digging my fingers into the soft topsoil. The other side was equally steep. At the bottom sat the flood lights. I placed my hand in front of one and the largest shadow puppet I've ever seen appeared on the massive stone wall. The castle, being the highest point in the city, could be seen by all of Dover. The silhouette of a man creeping by surely would attract attention. I killed the light.</p>
					<p>Now under the cover of darkness, I approached the outer wall. At a distance it looked as though I could scale it, but it was now apparent that there was no way. I started around the side looking for a way up, over, or through. A low wall appeared jutting out from the main structure, maybe nine or ten feet high. I took a running start, leaped, grabbed the top and struggled up. The other side wasn't a drop, but merely elevated terrain. Now there was a wall to my left, maybe twelve or fifteen feet up, and another to my right towering 30 feet into the night sky. I walked along through thick plant growth for a what seemed to be 100 feet or more. There was another drop. All around me were small windows, once the posts of archers. The drop seemed to go on forever, I couldn't tell if it was 5 feet or 50. I found a rock, tossed it over and waited for a sound. I couldn't hear anything over the rain.</p>
					<p>After finding a secure handhold, I slowly lowered myself into the unknown. As my head passed beneath my hands I kicked my feet from side to side, extended at the ankle, I felt nothing and pulled myself back up. Not ready to give up so soon, I went over again, this time fully extending my arms. I could feel the foliage rub against the cuffs of my pants. I let go.</p>
					<p>The ground was a mere 6 inches down. A few steps more and I reached a wall similar to the one I had just descended. I climbed it with ease. I once again found myself in a similar environment. Enclosed by walls on either side, walking through tall grass and under the raining night sky. At the end of the pathway there was yet again another drop, this time though it was much farther than I could manage, a good 3 stories. However, to my right was a pitched roof made of stone. The rain had made it slick so I crawled across it. The roof adjoined one of the primary walls of the castle and just out of arms reach a window sill.</p>
					<p>The window had no glass, but iron bars. The bars were old and looked as though they had been repaired. The upper bar traversing the window was held in place with two carriage bolts on either side. I stretched for the sill, just unable to reach it. Arms out, I let myself fall from the roof and grabbed the ledge.</p>
					<p>I found a foothold and climbed up onto the sill. The bars were widely spaced, but I could not fit my head between any of them. The upper bar looked poorly secured. I pulled on it, and sure enough it slid right out of place. The opening it created allowed just enough room for my head and shoulders. I went in head first, grabbing the barrel of a canon as I lowered myself down.</p>
					<p>Well, I'm kinda tired of writing about this now... so let me sum it up real quick. I wandered around the inside of the castle. Found some bats at the top of a wide shaft I climbed up into a tower using this tiny ass rope someone had left there. I got out after looking around everywhere I could get to and then I couldn't find my way off the mountain. So I got stuck in the rain for hours, thought I was going to go into hypothermia if I didn't get off in time because I was soaked. So I jumped from tree to tree in the blackness and finally got down after walking in circles for hours. I was covered in scratches all my clothes were ripped and I looked like shit.</p>
					<p>When I got down I met some people on the street, told them the story, they took me in for a small fee. I later learned they were heroin addicts and were using the money to get high, but all in all really good people... which seems oxymoronic, but it's complicated. So after I stayed with them for a couple days I got on a boat and went to Calais. And as it turns out, Calais is way more fucked up than Dover. So I'll talk about that now.</p>

					<h3>London</h3>
					<h4>The Boring Stuff</h4>
					<p><span class="date">June 24th, 2014. </span> It was my 24th birthday and I was glad to be in London. I landed in Gatwick not realizing it is quite the distance from the city center. After the difficulty with Icelandic immigration I was concerned that they wouldn't let me in, but it went fairly well I suppose. This immigration officer didn't yell at me and probably wasn't a descendent of a Viking, so all and all it was a fairly pleasant experience relatively speaking. I caught a train from Gatwick to West Minster where I looked at some touristy things, a big cathedral and the like. I saw Buckingham palace on the map, but I'm not much for monarchy so I didn't go look at it... okay, I wondered around aimlessly, or as some might say “lost”, for 4ish hours, and I just didn't happen across it. I did however happen across a game of cricket. I really enjoy watching cricket given its similarity to baseball. I even used to play every now and again.</p>
					<p>After walking about a bit more I found myself, quite by accident, standing in front of Parliament. There were a number of tourists taking pictures and doing, I don't know, whatever tourists do. Really it was quite boring, though the architecture was quite impressive. Part of the building was undergoing some maintenance that pretty well fucked the whole aesthetic of the place.</p>
					<p>I went into a number of cafes in search of an internet connection, but didn't have much luck. In the late afternoon I found a wine bar named Jamie’s (I think it's a local chain) with WIFI or as some pronounce it Wee-FEE. I think this is great because it sounds like a nickname for a dimple faced little kid or maybe a euphemism for a penis or better yet a “wee fee” because it actually costs money to take a piss here. It's no wonder the streets reek of urine.</p>
					<p>So at Jamie's I met an guy whom I started chatting with... about... I don't know... European uses of the term “lassiez faire” and denotative, if you will, libertarian thought and ideology in the political sense, and we chatted about ISIS, and social change, cryptocurrency, decentralization etc., etc. Gary Abbot as he was called, told me it was up to my generation to fix the worlds problems because at 45 he was too old. I told Gary Abbot he was full of shit and he should do it. Gary Abbot, told me he has high expectations.</p>

					<!-- these are line breaks -->
					<br>	
					<h4>London – Can be exciting? Yes.</h4>
					<br>

					<p>Disclaimer: If you are my mother, or grandmother, or someone that falls into a similar role, you may want to skip over this.</p>
					<p>Gary was well dressed and well off. He went in to take a piss, leaving his pack of cigarettes outside. It was mostly full. I took 5 or 10 smokes and gave them to an “outside person” as is the preferred term by outside people here or so it seems. Gary came back and we continued on with the chat. He bought me a beer. I had several, 3 maybe. Enough that I confessed to my crime later. Gary approved. I very much enjoyed our chat, but Gary was not simply a nice bar companion, he was my last ditch effort at getting in somewhere free for the night. As he was preparing to depart, I casually asked, “Where's a good place to stay around here?” He was surprised by the question. “You haven't got a bed?!?” he exclaimed with the pitch of his voice rising throughout. He told me he didn't have anything for me and that he was sorry. His departure seemed to be hastened by this topic. Gary knew. And I was on my own.</p>
					<br>
					<p>***</p>
					<br>
					<p>I tried hostels, but they were all booked. I must have tried 5 or 10 before deciding I'd go for one of the higher priced hotels. It was filled as well, and so was the next, and the next. It had been a long time since I got a full nights rest and it was catching up with me. I wasn't quite ready to give up on finding a bed when I met another guy. He was young, about my age, but I could tell he'd been around. He seemed to have an idea as to where I should go. “Follow me” he said. I was somewhat hesitant and he could tell, but I imagine that in his mind the hesitation manifested itself in my confusion. I wasn't confused.</p>
					<p>There are many street people that are good, especially good, if we measure good in humanism or empathy anyway. When you have nothing you are more willing to give everything. Because you know. And you don't just know the way you know something from a textbook, it's an emotional knowledge with great fluidity. It can't be described here. It's not simply an idea that can be condensed to words, but an experience. And it's this hyperhospitallity that is scary, because when it is used to manipulate, it's difficult to distinguish.</p>
					<p>Nonetheless, I was gambling by following. I ran through the possibilities: 1) He tries to hold me up on his own. 2) He is leading me to his friends to help in the robbing. 3) He understands my position and is using his knowledge of the area to assist me.</p>
					<p>Option 1 doesn't concern me too much. Guns are fairly uncommon here and he probably can't afford one. Worst case option 1 he has a knife. I think my chances are pretty good given Option 1. Option 2 is of course the scariest. Without weapons, two or three or four guys of average build, isn't too intimidating. People are adverse to violence. And I know my willingness to inflict it, and the experience of doing so is valuable here. If Option 2 is well-executed, and I imagine it would be as he seems bright, running won't be a readily available option. He'll take me to a semi-enclosed area. Which makes sense in the context of looking for somewhere to sleep, so I can't just stop in the middle of the entrance way without offending him. And there may be people waiting.</p>
					<p>We walk to the University of London. He shows me a few places to crash, all basement fire escapes. They don't look especially appealing. I had already scouted a number of spots in between hotel and hostel knocking, you know – just in case, and they were of similar quality. I was unimpressed. Then he suggested a small park. The gates were all locked and it was enclosed by a six foot wrought iron fence with “decorative” spikes atop. He went over the security situation with me. “There are two officers on patrol at night...” he began. After familiarizing me with the guard shifts, the CCTV, and the park times, I agreed it was a good spot to stay the night and hopped the fence. If he was going to come back with friends, I was pretty well stuck.</p>
					<p>I found myself in a shelter. It had 3 walls, all with openings, but none large enough to climb in or out of. There was one-way in and one-way out. I pulled the sleeping bag from my pack and laid on a bench that traced the walls and ate a doughnut salvaged earlier in the day. Generally, it's a bad idea to remove ones shoes while sleeping outside in the city. If something happens, you're unprepared. Or worse, if you go to jail without them. I've never been. I'm as lucky as I'm privileged. I took them off anyway and used them as a pillow.</p>
					<p>The nearby traffic was disconcerting. In order to sleep, I'd have to tune it out, and that meant tuning it everything out. I closed my eyes. I heard the sound of metal on metal, keys maybe. I shot up taking extra care not to expose myself. Nothing. 10 minutes passed and a flickering light appeared on the road, it was the guard with a flashlight. He walked past. I drifted off.</p>
					<p>I woke  to the sunrise having slept the whole night. Immediately, I checked for my bag and various belongings. All were still there. I had gotten a solid 5 hours, good for the street. I was parched. I gathered my things and hopped the fence once more. </p>

					<br>
					<p>***</p>
					<br>

					<p>Walking down the road I searched for a coffee shop or a hostel. I tried two more hostels with no luck. I saw the King's Cross bus and I thought of my sister, an obsessive Harry Potter fan. The thought of her reaction, surely one of jealous laughter, made me smile.</p>
					<p>Up ahead, lying on the sidewalk, was a man. His feet were in the road, which was very busy. It seemed like an unnatural place to be and position to be in. I walked up to him. He looked very pale. I wondered if he was dead. He was wearing a thin brown t-shirt and it was chilly. His chest rose as he took a breath. There was a construction site next to us and I wondered if he had fallen, but there was no where to fall from.</p>
					<p>I loudly said, “Hey. Man. You can't be here.” There was no response.</p>
					<p>I tried again, but this time yelling in his ear, “Brother! Gidup!” </p>
					<p>Still, there was nothing. I nudged him with my boot and was met with the same unresponsiveness. His arms were large and he looked athletic. I thought maybe he had Od'd on a stimulant like bath salts or something and I didn't want my face eaten. I continued my efforts and aggressively shook his arm. He grunted. I shook him again.</p>
					<p>“Brother! You have to get up! You are in the middle of the street.”  I said.</p>
					<p>He sat up and I offered to help him. He declined, but could barely speak. I picked him up anyway. He couldn't stand unassisted and I led him to a fence and he held on to it. He was shaking uncontrollably from the cold. As I wrestled a sweater on him another man approached and asked if everything was okay. I explained the situation. Later he would introduce himself as Matt, an Irish-Caribbean man he proudly claimed. Matt, a massive and muscular man, and I escorted the other fellow to a nearby park having ascertained that he was just pissed drunk and needed to sleep it off. Matt got him some water. He drank a little. Within minutes it was like he came alive again. He must have been severely dehydrated because he went from unresponsiveness to alert and articulate, but still drunk, in a matter of fifteen minutes. I'd never seen anything like it. Matt brought us a cup of tea and the three of us had a chat then went our separate ways.</p>
					<p>And now I'm in a coffee shop. Having a cup of tea. And telling the story of yesterday. I would very much like a place to stay. I should call my relatives, but I'm nervous about it. Also, I have plans today with Amanda X. Who is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met in my life. When I'm single, I say the most, but I'm sorta not, not single I mean, and I don't want to upset the person that makes me sorta not single, because I do care about her very much. Yeah, that's about it.</p>
