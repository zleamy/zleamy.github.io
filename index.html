				London – The Boring Stuff
				<div>
	June 24th, 2014. It was my 24th birthday and I was glad to be in London. I landed in Gatwick not realizing it is quite the distance from the city center. After the difficulty with Icelandic immigration I was concerned that they wouldn't let me in, but it went fairly well I suppose. This immigration officer didn't yell at me and probably wasn't a descendent of a Viking, so all and all it was a fairly pleasant experience relatively speaking. I caught a train from Gatwick to West Minster where I looked at some touristy things, a big cathedral and the like. I saw Buckingham palace on the map, but I'm not much for monarchy so I didn't go look at it... okay, I wondered around aimlessly, or as some might say “lost”, for 4ish hours, and I just didn't happen across it. I did however happen across a game of cricket. I really enjoy watching cricket given its similarity to baseball. I even used to play every now and again.
	After walking about a bit more I found myself, quite by accident, standing in front of Parliament. There were a number of tourists taking pictures and doing, I don't know, whatever tourists do. Really it was quite boring, though the architecture was quite impressive. Part of the building was undergoing some maintenance that pretty well fucked the whole aesthetic of the place.
	I went into a number of cafes in search of an internet connection, but didn't have much luck. In the late afternoon I found a wine bar named Jamie’s (I think it's a local chain) with WIFI or as some pronounce it Wee-FEE. I think this is great because it sounds like a nickname for a dimple faced little kid or maybe a euphemism for a penis or better yet a “wee fee” because it actually costs money to take a piss here. It's no wonder the streets reek of urine.
	So at Jamie's I met an guy whom I started chatting with... about... I don't know... European uses of the term “lassiez faire” and denotative, if you will, libertarian thought and ideology in the political sense, and we chatted about ISIS, and social change, cryptocurrency, decentralization etc., etc. Gary Abbot as he was called, told me it was up to my generation to fix the worlds probems because at 45 he was too old. I told Gary Abbot he was full of shit and he should do it. Gary Abbot, told me he has high expectations.</p>

<p>London – Can be exciting? Yes.

	Disclaimer: If you are my mother, or grandmother, or someone that falls into a similar role, you may want to skip over this.
	Gary was well dressed and well off. He went in to take a piss, leaving his pack of cigarettes outside. It was mostly full. I took 5 or 10 smokes and gave them to an “outside person” as is the preferred term by outside people or so it seems. Gary came back and we continued on with the chat. He bought me a beer. I had several, 3 maybe. Enough that I confessed to my crime later. Gary approved. I very much enjoyed our chat, but Gary was not simply a nice bar companion, he was my last ditch effort at getting in somewhere free for the night. As he was preparing to depart, I casually asked, “Where's a good place to stay around here?” He was surprised by the question. “You haven't got a bed.” he exclaimed with the pitch of his voice rising throughout. He told me he didn't have anything for me and that he was sorry. His departure seemed to be hastened by this topic. Gary knew. And I was on my own.
	***
	I tried hostels, but they were all booked. I must have tried 5 or 10 before deciding I'd go for one of the higher priced hotels. It was filled as well, and so was the next, and the next. It had been a long time since I got a full nights rest and it was catching up with me. I wasn't quite ready to give up on finding a bed when I met another guy. He was young, about my age, but I could tell he'd been around. He seemed to have an idea as to where I should go. “Follow me” he said. I was somewhat hesitant and he could tell, but I imagine that in his mind the hesitation manifested itself in my confusion. I wasn't confused.
	There are many street people that are good, especially good, if we measure good in humanism or empathy anyway. When you have nothing you are more willing to give everything. Because you know. And you don't just know the way you know something from a textbook, it's an emotional knowledge with great fluidity. It can't be described here. It's not simply an idea that can be condensed to words, but an experience. And it's this hyperhospitallity that is scary, because when it is used to manipulate, it's difficult to distinguish.
	Nonetheless, I was gambling by following. I ran through the possibilities: 1) He tries to hold me up on his own. 2) He is leading me to his friends to help in the robbing. 3) He understands my position and is using his knowledge of the area to assist me.
	Option 1 Doesn't concern me too much. Guns are fairly uncommon here and he probably can't afford one. Worst case option 1 he has a knife. I think my chances are pretty good given Option 1. Option 2 is of course the scariest. Without weapons, two or three or four guys of average build, isn't too intimidating. People are adverse to violence. And I know my willingness to inflict it, and the experience of doing so is valuable here. If Option 2 is well-executed, and I imagine it would be as he seems bright, running won't be a readily available option. He'll take me to a semi-enclosed area. Which makes sense in the context of looking for somewhere to sleep, so I can't just stop in the middle of the entrance way without offending him. And there may be people waiting.
	We walk to the University of London. He shows me a few options, all basement fire escapes. They don't look especially appealing. I had already been scouting spots in between hotel and hostel knocking, you know – just in case, and they were of similar quality. I was unimpressed and made nervous. Any first time street sleeper would see those options quickly. Then he suggested a small park. 	The gates were all locked and it was enclosed by a six foot wrought iron fence with “decorative” spikes atop. He went over the security situation with me. “There are two officers on patrol at night...” he began. After familiarizing me with the guard shifts, the CCTV, and the park times, I agreed it was a good option and hopped the fence. 
	If he was going to come back with friends, I was pretty well stuck. I found myself in a shelter. It had 3 walls, all with openings, but none large enough to climb in or out of. There was one-way in and one-way out. I pulled the sleeping bag from my pack and laid on a bench that traced the walls and ate a doughnut salvaged earlier in the day. Generally, it's a bad idea to remove ones shoes while sleeping outside in the city. If something happens, you're unprepared. Or worse, if you go to jail without them. I've never been. I'm as lucky as I'm privileged. I took them off anyway and used them as a pillow.
	The nearby traffic was disconcerting. In order to sleep, I'd have to tune it out, and that meant tuning it all out. I closed my eyes. I heard the sound of metal on metal, keys maybe. I shot up taking extra care not to expose myself. Nothing. 10 minutes passed and a flickering light appeared on the road, it was the guard with a flashlight. He walked past. I drifted off.
	I woke the to the sunrise having slept the whole night. Immediately I checked for my bag and various belongings. All were still there. I had gotten a solid 5 hours, good for the street. I was parched. I gathered my things and hopped the fence. 
	***
	Walking down the road I searched for a coffee shop or a hostel. I tried two more hostels with no luck. I saw the King's Cross bus and I thought of my sister, an obsessive Harry Potter fan. The thought of her reaction, surely one of jealous laughter, made me smile.
	Up ahead, lying on the sidewalk, was a man. His feet were in the road, which was very busy. It seemed like an unnatural place to be and position to be in. I walked up to him. He looked very pale. I wondered if he was dead. He was wearing a thin brown t-shirt and it was chilly. His chest rose as he took a breath. There was a construction site directly next to us and I wondered if he had fallen, but there was no where to fall from. 
I loudly said, “Hey. Man. You can't be here.” There was no response. 
I tried again, but this time yelling in his ear, “Brother! Gidup!” 
Still, there was nothing. I nudged him with my boot and was met with the same unresponsiveness. His arms were large, and he looked rather athletic. I thought maybe he had Od'd on a stimulant and I didn't want my face eaten. I continued my efforts and aggressively shook his arm. He grunted. I shook him again. 
“Brother! You have to get up! You are in the middle of the street.”  I said.
He sat up and I offered to help him. He declined, but could barely speak. I picked him up anyway. He couldn't stand unassisted and I led him to a fence which he grabbed hold of. He was shaking uncontrollably. As I wrestled a sweater on him another man approached and asked if everything was okay. I explained the situation. Later he would introduce himself as Matt, an Irish-Caribbean man he proudly claimed. Matt, a massive and muscular man, and I escorted the fellow to a near by park as we were able to ascertain that he was just piss drunk. Matt got him some water. He drank a little. Within minutes it was like he came alive again. He must have been severely dehydrated because he went from unresponsiveness to alert and articulate, but still drunk, in a matter of fifteen minutes. I'd never seen anything like it. Matt brought us a cup of tea and the three of us had a chat then went our separate ways.
	And now I'm in a coffee shop. Having a cup of tea. And telling the story of yesterday. I would very much like a place to stay. I should call my relatives, but I'm nervous about it. Also, I have plans today with Amanda Yee. Who is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met in my life. When I'm single, I say the most, but I'm sorta not, and I don't want to upset the person that makes me sorta not single, because I do care very much about her. Yeah, that's about it.</p>
